# A Simple Synth
 This simple synthesizer was made using the JUCE audio framework and employs the use of four oscillators: Sine, Square, Triangle and Sawtooth. The synth also includes a high pass and low pass filter, as well as a distortion parameter that allows the user to more easily dial in the sound they are going for.
